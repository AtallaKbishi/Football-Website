            Futbol Club Barcelona, commonly referred to as Barcelona and
            colloquially known as Barça , is a professional football club based
            in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top
            flight of Spanish football.

            Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, German and English
            footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of
            Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club"
            ("More than a club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the
            supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable
            sports team in the world, worth $4.76 billion, and the world's
            fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual
            turnover of €582.1 million.[2][3] The official Barcelona anthem is
            the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria
            Espinàs.[4] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and
            red stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.

            Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 75 trophies: 26 La Liga, 31
            Copa del Rey, thirteen Supercopa de España, three Copa Eva Duarte,
            and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder
            for the latter four competitions. In international club football,
            the club has won twenty European and worldwide titles: five UEFA
            Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a
            joint record five UEFA Super Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs
            Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups.[5] Barcelona was ranked first
            in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics
            Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015, and occupies
            the sixth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May
            2022.[6][7][8] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real
            Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as El
            Clásico.

            Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world,
            and the club has one of the largest social media following in the
            world among sports teams.[9][10] Barcelona players have won a record
            twelve Ballon d'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff,
            as well as a record seven FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with
            winners including Romário, Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. In 2010,
            three players who came through the club's youth academy (Lionel
            Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen as the three best
            players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an
            unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy.
            Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight
            European Golden Shoe awards.

            Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División
            that have never been relegated from the top division since its
            inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In
            2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental
            treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions
            League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win six
            out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the
            Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup.[11] In
            2011, the club became European champions again, winning five
            trophies. This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just
            four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport
            to be the greatest team of all time.[12][13][14] By winning their
            fifth Champions League trophy in 2015, Barcelona became the first
            European football club in history to achieve the continental treble
            twice.
