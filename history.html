            Walter Wild, the club's first president (1899-1901). His main
            achievement was getting Barça its first home ground.[15] "SPORT
            NOTES Our friend and partner, Mr. Kans Kamper, from the Foot-Vall
            Section of the Sociedad Los Deportes and former Swiss champion,
            wishing to organize some matches in Barcelona, requests that
            everyone who likes this sport contact him, come to this office
            Tuesday and Friday nights from 9 to 11." Gamper's advertisement in
            Los Deportes — English translation: "SPORT NOTE. Our friend and
            partner, Mr. Kans Kamper, from the Foot-Vall Section of the
            'Sociedad Los Deportes' and former Swiss champion, wishing to
            organise some matches in Barcelona, requests that everyone who likes
            this sport contact him, come to this office Tuesday and Friday
            nights from 9 to 11."[16] On 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper
            placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a
            football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the
            Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended - Walter Wild
            (the first director of the club), Lluís d'Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas,
            Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol,
            Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons - and Foot-Ball Club
            Barcelona was born.[16][17]

            A formation of FC Barcelona in 1903 FC Barcelona had a successful
            start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de
            Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1902, the club won its first
            trophy, the Copa Macaya, and participated in the first Copa del Rey,
            losing 1-2 to Bizcaya in the final.[18] In 1908, Hans Gamper - now
            known as Joan Gamper - became club president in a desperate attempt
            to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not
            just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not
            winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He
            said in a meeting, "Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there
            is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility
            of running the club from now on."[19] Club president on five
            separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total
            at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire
            its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.[20]

            On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a
            stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new
            surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year.
            Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest
            that the club still wears - with some minor changes - as of the
            present day.[21]

            With the new stadium, Barcelona participated in the inaugural
            version of the Pyrenees Cup, which, at the time, consisted of the
            best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the
            Basque Country and Catalonia; all were former members of the Marca
            Hispanica region. The contest was the most prestigious in that
            era.[22] From the inaugural year in 1910 to 1913, Barcelona won the
            competition four consecutive times. Carles Comamala played an
            integral part of the four-time champion, managing the side along
            with Amechazurra and Jack Greenwell. The latter became the club's
            first full-time coach in 1917.[23] The last edition was held in 1914
            in the city of Barcelona, which local rivals Espanyol won.[24]

            During the same period, the club changed its official language from
            Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol
            of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had
            less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the
            club's collective identity.[25] On 4 February 1917, the club held
            its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba, who played
            from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa where
            Barcelona won the match 6-2.[26]

            Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club
            members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped
            finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes,
            which they inaugurated the same year.[27] Les Cortes had an initial
            capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.[28]

            Gamper recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in
            Barcelona's history. After this hiring, the club's fortunes began to
            improve on the field. During the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won
            eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees
            Cups and enjoyed its first "golden age".[18][20]
